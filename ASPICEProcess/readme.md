# Analyze and use the ASPICE system development process:

Bachelor thesis written at Bosch GMBH. I have created a system for database monitoring in DXL and python language. The system would go trough the requirement database, and if it found errors or missing information would send emails and statistics directly to the file owners. Performed also the system architecture planning for the computer responsible for car ignition. Here only the documentation is available, the code falls under NDA.
The thesis is in English in the attached file you can read it. For the system architecture the images are not depicting the actual system, it is just a template for a hypothetical ignition system.
