# Development of an Augmented Reality Engine Based on Real-time Object Detection

The project is based on the DarkNet framework. I have collected a dataset and trained a YOLO2 classifier. The application relies on heavy parallel computations and asyncronous threads. Also implemented an anomaly detection algorithm from a recent paper for more reliability.

The most interesting parts of the work:
- Collecting a dataset from internet
- Handlabelling and cleaning the dataset
- Training the set on Goolge CLoud VMs
- Using threads and asyncronous pipes for realtime performance
- Experimented with different filters and anomaly detection algorithms for better performance
- Using voice and translation apis
- Live webcam feed
- Wrote everything as a paper
