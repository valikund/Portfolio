Turtlebot Soccer:

Programmed two turtlebot robots to be able to pass a ball and score a goal. Wrote this project with Yu Sin Lin for Cooperative Robotics subject. The turtlebots are programmed in rospy. They use odometry and rgb-d cameras as sensors. The interesting part is that the image preprocessing is really slow and noisy, for this reason we used several tricks for sensor filtering and calibration. For filtering we applied hierarchical clustering.
